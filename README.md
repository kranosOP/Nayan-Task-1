# Nayan-Task-1
In the main method, I have created two Car objects with dummy data and tested all the methods using those objects. I have made collision detection method to measure the distance and return true if distance between two cars is less than 5 units otherwise false. I have made time in collision method to calculate the time before collision between the cars. Methods such as accelerate and decclerate would increase and decrease the speed of car respectively. Method move will update the coordinates of car depending upon the angle in which it is moving and the speed it attains. I have made this code in 3D considering out spherical coordinates amd concept of flying cars. This code car also be made user input ,in which user can put any values to try whether cars are colliding or not.
